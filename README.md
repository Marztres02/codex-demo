# OpenAI Codex Demo

## Repository Goal
This project exists to prepare a practical demo of OpenAI Codex, showcasing how a generative model can turn natural language instructions into code snippets that solve real tasks.

## What is OpenAI Codex?
- It is an OpenAI system designed to **translate natural language into code** and is available through the company's API.
- The model is a **direct descendant of GPT-3** and was trained on natural language plus **billions of lines of public code**, including GitHub repositories.
- It **powers GitHub Copilot** and works with **more than a dozen programming languages**, interpreting short commands and running them on behalf of the user.

The information above comes from the official OpenAI announcement about Codex, published on August 10, 2021, which also highlights ongoing updates about the system's evolution.

## Demo Ideas
1. Create a flow where a person describes a task in natural language and Codex suggests the corresponding code.
2. Analyze how it modifies existing snippets based on new instructions.
3. Showcase best practices and limitations identified during testing.
